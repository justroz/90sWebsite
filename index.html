                For undergrad, I attended the Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University affectionately known as FAMU. It sits on the highest of 7 hills in the capitol city, Tallahassee, FL. I majored in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing.

                My Masters degree is from the University of Houston in Educational Supervision and Administration.
